## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 3 Part 2
Another one of my favorite labs this semester was the Date Difference lab, where we wrote a program to calculate the number of days between two dates using the Julian Day formula. I liked this lab because it felt more like a real-world tool, since you could use it to figure out things like how many days are left until a big event or how long it has been since an important date. It also helped me practice writing and using multiple functions, like JulianDay, DateDifference, and PrintDate, instead of putting everything in main. I had to be careful with the long formula from Fliegel and Van Flandern, and it taught me how small mistakes in parentheses or operators can completely change the result. I also got more comfortable using make, fixing compile errors, and running the test cases to check my logic. Overall, this lab made me feel more confident working with functions, integers, and dates, and it showed me how math and programming can work together to solve a practical problem.

Lab 4 Part 1
Another lab that I really liked this semester was the Units Conversion lab, where we wrote a program that converts milliliters into teaspoons, tablespoons, ounces, and cups. I enjoyed this lab because it made math, functions, and C++ feel more connected to something we actually use in everyday life, like cooking or reading a recipe. It helped me get more comfortable working with double values, doing step by step conversions with the given ratios, and thinking carefully about how small rounding differences can happen with floating point numbers. I also liked that the lab required us to split the work into multiple functions in units_functions.cc, instead of putting everything in main, because it showed me how cleaner and more organized code is easier to test and reuse. Running make, make unittest, and make test to check my code, along with make format and make lint, also reminded me how important it is to not only get the right answer but also follow style and structure rules. Overall, this lab helped me practice breaking a problem into smaller pieces and made me feel more confident about writing and testing functions in C++.

Lab 6 Part 1
One of my favorite labs this semester was the Sandwich Lab, where we created a small program that builds a Mad Lib-style sandwich order using command-line arguments. I liked this lab because it was the first time I really understood how argc and argv work in an actual program instead of just reading about them. It also taught me how to clean command-line input and validate that the user supplied the right number of arguments, which is something I hadn’t realized was so important. I enjoyed testing the program with different types of sandwich ingredients and watching how the output changed. The lab helped me feel more confident with vectors, strings, input validation, and debugging compile errors using the make command. It was simple, but it made me feel like I was writing something that could be part of a real ordering system, which made it fun and memorable.
